This is my final project for my Software Arch class. I Developed this project to follow a few design priciples which are, Strategy Pattern, Factory Method Pattern, and the Singleton Pattern.
This program is a text base game where the user pick a class (Archer, Mage, Paladin, or Peasant) and duels a AI which is also be one of those classes. 
Each character class has a light attack which is weak, a heavy attack which does a large amount of damage but makes the user skip their next turn, and a defend attack. 
All these abilities change depend on the class a player picks. Also the program was developed to be highly modular so movesets and classes can be added easily.
